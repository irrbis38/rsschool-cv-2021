### 3. About
	
I'm 37 years old. Married. I have two kids.

I have been studying web technologies for a year.
During this time, I studied HTML/CSS-coding.
Completed few projects as a web-developer.
But my purpose is to become a true JavaScript developer.
Now I am learning JavaScript and React.

* HTML5
* CSS3 (flexbox, grid)
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* BEM
* Bootstrap (just grid)
* Git

### 5. Sample of code
Sample of code here:

```javascript
const foo = (s) => {
  let result;
  if (s.length % 2 !== 0) {
    result = s[Math.ceil(s.length/2) - 1];
  } else {
    result = `${s[s.length/2 - 1]}${s[s.length/2]}`;
  }
  console.log(result);
  output.textContent = result;
};
```

### 7. Education
I acquired all my knowledge on my own, reading books, manuals and watching video courses.
In the process of studying, I actively used the Internet resources [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [JavaScript.RU](https://learn.javascript.ru/), as well as video courses from the [Computer Training Center "Specialist" at The Bauman Moscow State Technical University](http://en.specialist.ru/).

### 8. English level
As the test results on training.by showed, my English level is A2.
My spoken English isn't good yet. I must study and practice more.
But right now I can read documentation and technical literature, also I can listen to simple podcasts.
Now I keep to improve my English. I read adapted B2-level literature, take the video course ["OK English"](https://www.youtube.com/user/elenavogni) and listening to [Teacher Luke's podcasts](https://teacherluke.co.uk/).
